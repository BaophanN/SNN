# Integer-Valued Training and Spike-Driven
Inference Spiking Neural Network for
High-performance and Energy-efficient Object
Detection

Benchmark on COCO (static dataset) and Gen1 (DVS) dataset. 
Comparable to YOLOv5. 

Direct training of SNN network 

Introduce I-LIF to improve training.

Built upon architecture of YOLOv8. 

Design new SNN-block
